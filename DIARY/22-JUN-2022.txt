I woke up on my terrace in the morning and did my daily chores and worked on the project in the morning as well as in the afternoon. I sent the zip files of my project to donia to work with the latest developments. Meanwhile, there was one of the big things going on in Indian politics as well as Maharashtra politics. Uddhav Thackeray's government was in the midst of the crisis. His own party MLAs’S rebelled against him and stayed at a hotel in Assam while it was immersed in the floods. Apart from politics, I attended the class at 5:30 pm and it was about the demo and a new project he added to our existing project. I completely focused on my Twitter feed as well as on the news because the chief minister of Maharashtra was live giving a speech to his state. It was an emotional one and he left his official bungalow “Varsha” for his family residence “matoshree”. It was a journey filled with emotions. I did my project and worked on the storyboard for the second one. I spoke to Mahesh about the exchange currency.
